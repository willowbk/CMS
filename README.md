# Complete Moveset Optimization Algorithm

This repository contains Python scripts for the Complete Moveset Search (CMS) optimization algorithm. This algorithm was developed for fitting a biophysical and population genetic model for the analysis of the codon usage bias.

If this algorithm is used for published research, please cite

# Installation

To install the optimizer, first download the depository and unzip the content into a desired location. Move to this directory in the terminal and run

\ pip install -e .

This will install the optimization algorithm and any dependencies. Once the installation is complete, the algorithm can be accessed by Python in any directory.
